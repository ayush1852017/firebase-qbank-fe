## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated blue (#4285F4) for a trustworthy and intellectual feel.
- Background color: Light grayish-blue (#E8F0FE), almost white, to provide a clean and calm background that doesn't distract from the content.
- Accent color: Vibrant violet (#825EE4) to add a touch of creativity and innovation. Used for interactive elements.
- Body font: 'Inter' sans-serif font, for a modern and neutral look that ensures readability and a clean interface. Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', also sans-serif, for computerized headlines.
- Use consistent line icons from a set like Material Design Icons to ensure uniformity. Use the primary color for active states and a desaturated version for inactive states.
- Use subtle fade-in animations for content loading and micro-interactions on button clicks. Keep animations short (under 300ms) to avoid delays.
- Implement a card-based layout with rounded corners for a modern and touch-friendly interface. Use consistent spacing and padding to maintain visual rhythm.
